# Location 

## Welcome to locations
This repository is going to be focused on using Lat. Long. points and determining where other lat/long points are located based on other inputs.

I will be learning Rust some more as this project progresses. So by no means should this be seen as production code or even good code for that matter. This will also be the ground for starting a UI project to learn on.

If you have found this, don't contribute to it. Reach out, if you can.

## Functionality
- Flow One:
  - Take in a single lat long point.
  - Take in a distance
  - Determine the lat long of the new point based on the provided distance.
- Flow Two: TODO
  - Take in a single lat lon pont.
  - take in a distance
  - create a bounding box around this point
